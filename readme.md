# weather Dashboard




## Desciption
a web application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display weather information for a user-selected city.

The application allows the user to search for a city and displays a list of matching cities. The user can then select a city from the list, and the application will display the current weather and a five-day forecast for that city.

The code initializes several variables and sets up event listeners for the search and select buttons. It also defines functions for clearing previous search and forecast results and for displaying the search results and weather information.

The code uses the jQuery library to manipulate the DOM and make AJAX requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. It also uses the Day.js library to format the date. The code stores previous search locations in the browser's local storage using JSON.

Overall, the code is well-organized and easy to follow. It uses descriptive variable names and includes comments to explain what each section of the code does. However, there are some areas where the code could be improved, such as error handling and code optimization.
